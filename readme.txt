This assignment is [80]% complete.
[Profile picture uploading is not working at the moment. We ran out of time and haven't had time to impliment it. Admin also does not have a profile page right now, only a dashboard]

Users:                  Password
admin@saveme.ca         test
responder@saveme.ca     test
caller@saveme.ca        test

Above are the 3 tiers of user. Admin acts as an admin. Caller and responder act as regular user. All inputs are validated and scrubbed on the backend and only admins have access to information that is not their own.
